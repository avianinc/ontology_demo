# OWL Demo with Fuseki

This repository contains a demonstration of how to use OWL (Web Ontology Language) with Apache Jena Fuseki for managing and querying ontology data. The provided script updates and queries an OWL model stored in a Fuseki server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Apache Jena Fuseki
- PyFuseki library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pyfuseki rdflib
    ```

3. Ensure Apache Jena Fuseki is running on `http://localhost:3030`. You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to set up Fuseki and Neo4j:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Variables

Modify the variables at the top of the script to customize the ontology prefix, Fuseki server URL, and fuel efficiency scores:

```python
FUSEKI_SERVER = 'http://localhost:3030'
DATABASE = 'model'
ONTOLOGY_PREFIX = 'http://example.org/ontology#'
new_fuel_efficiency_score = 7
fuel_efficiency_threshold = 5
```

## Usage

1. **Update Fuel Efficiency Score**

   The script updates the `fuelEfficiencyScore` for `Aircraft1` and prints the updated data.

2. **Perform SPARQL Queries**

   The script performs the following SPARQL queries:
   - Retrieve aircraft and their fuel efficiency scores.
   - Retrieve aircraft with a fuel efficiency score above the specified threshold and their corresponding mission success scores.
   - Retrieve the payload configuration with the highest mission success score.

3. **Execute the Script**

   Run the script to update the ontology data and perform the queries:
   ```sh
   python update_ac1_fueleff.py
   ```

## Output

The script will output the results of the queries to the console:

```sh
Ontology model has been uploaded to Fuseki.
Fuel efficiency score updated for Aircraft1.

Query 1 Results (Retrieve aircraft and their fuel efficiency scores):
Aircraft: http://example.org/ontology#Aircraft1, Fuel Efficiency Score: 7
Aircraft: http://example.org/ontology#Aircraft2, Fuel Efficiency Score: 6

Decision Query Results (Aircraft with Fuel Efficiency > 5 and their corresponding mission success scores):
Aircraft: http://example.org/ontology#Aircraft1, Fuel Efficiency Score: 7, Mission: http://example.org/ontology#Mission1, Mission Success Score: 8

Optimal Payload Configuration Results (Payload with the highest mission success score):
Payload: http://example.org/ontology#Payload1, Mission Success Score: 8
```
